                        <h1>Pokemon Cardgame</h1>
                        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                        <p>A Pokemon card game inspired by the homonymous anime and videogame. The idea is that the
                            player should pick a card containing one of the 151 monsters of the first generation of
                            Pokemon and selects one of its attributes. Next, the machine must also take a card and
                            presents it. The one with the highest value of the given characteristic wins the match. The
                            JavaScript code running the program guarantees that the cards are selected randomly and that
                            adversaries will never pick the same monsters at the round.</p>

                        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                        <p>An interactive classification board to follow the Pokemon card game in which the users can
                            add as many players as it wants to the competition. One can also change the number of
                            victories (3 points), ties (1 point), and losses (0 points) of each contestant, thereby
                            automatically altering the scoreboard. In case of mistakes, a single click in the "zerar o
                            placar" resets the stats of each player individually. When the matches are over, the players
                            can remove all the data from the chart by pressing the "limpar a tabela" button. </p>

                        <p>This project aimed to create a game designed to show high school students that learning maths
                            can be both funny and useful, especially since a lack of interest in the subjects taught at
                            school is the main cause of evasion among teenagers. While accessing the application, the
                            students will find a math challenge, which they will have three chances to solve. Storing
                            the results in a database shall encourage disputes among classmates, thereby creating
                            interest in the subject. The teachers can also use the answers for evaluation. I was
                            responsible for creating the page structure and design.</p>

                            sovereignty over the world. Although the display beneath the keyboard shows the user the
                            dialed number, what didn't happen back then, the main nostalgia factor comes from the
                            rotary-phone sound effect played every time one of the keys is pressed.</p>
